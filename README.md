# OAT_SA_SWAT+

One at a time Sensitivity Analysis of SWAT+ model parameters on streamflow components simulation. Supplementary materials of the manuscript entitled *Groundwater modelling within SWAT+: Considerations for a realistic baseflow simulation*

This repository contains gif objects that show the effect of 17 SWAT+ parameters on the streamflow componentes simulation.

The parameters and other information of the methodology of the work can be found in the manuscrip.

The **OAT_gifs** folder contains gifs for each of the parameters, and an additional Power Point document where the effect of all the parameters can be observed at the same time.
